    <p class="description">Videogames monetization has become more and more predatory over the years, with the exploitation of behavioral psychology to lure people into spending money.<br><br>However, the most part of the governments in the world is still reluctant to address
      these systems as gambling, as well as to take measures against them. Inquest is an independent magazine that analyzes the subtle mechanics developed by the industry, for the purpose of making the consumers aware.<br><br>The series is formed by four
      issues, each one addressing one particular gambling trick used by the industry. Issue 0, the one that was fully designed and printed, focuses on loot boxes.
